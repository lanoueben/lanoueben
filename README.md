Hello, I'm Benjamin Lanoue (@lanoueben) and I've graduated North Central College with a Bachelors in Science, Computer Science degree. I might upload some projects I work on every now and then.

I've had a wide array of programming experiences. Some languages I've utilized
are java, python, c++, c#, and C. Some Topics I've covered include object oriented
programming, game development, big data management, and algorithms.

My most recent project was an NFL winning percentage calculator which utilized logistic regression machine learning to create models for prediction.

For now I'm utilizing HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Javascript to practice web development.
